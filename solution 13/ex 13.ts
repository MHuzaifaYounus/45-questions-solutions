// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
let list = ["Bicycle","Motorcycle","Helicopter","Train","Red Bus"];

console.log(`${list[0]} : A bicycle is a useful vehicle that helps us reach a destination without polluting the environment.`)
console.log(`${list[1]} : motorcycle accidents had increasingly become a problem for countries `)
console.log(`${list[2]} : I have always admired the power and grace of a sleek Bell 407 helicopter.`)
console.log(`${list[3]} : Some trains are old and make a chugging sound, which is nice.`)
console.log(`${list[4]} : The red buses in Pakistan are a common sight on the roads.`)
