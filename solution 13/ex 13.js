// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
var list = ["Bicycle", "Motorcycle", "Helicopter", "Train", "Red Bus"];
console.log("".concat(list[0], " : A bicycle is a useful vehicle that helps us reach a destination without polluting the environment."));
console.log("".concat(list[1], " : motorcycle accidents had increasingly become a problem for countries "));
console.log("".concat(list[2], " : I have always admired the power and grace of a sleek Bell 407 helicopter."));
console.log("".concat(list[3], " : Some trains are old and make a chugging sound, which is nice."));
console.log("".concat(list[4], " : The red buses in Pakistan are a common sight on the roads."));
