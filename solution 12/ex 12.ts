// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var names = ["Adil", "Areeb", "Anus", "Irtiza"];
for (var key = 0; key < names.length; key++) {
    console.log("Good to see you : "+ names[key]);
}
